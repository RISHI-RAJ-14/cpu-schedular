# cpu-schedular
A Python CLI tool to simulate CPU scheduling algorithms like FCFS, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling.
# ðŸ§  CPU Task Scheduler (Python CLI App)

This is a simple **CPU Task Scheduler** simulator built using Python. It supports the following scheduling algorithms:

- **First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**
- **Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling**

The user is prompted to input task details (name, burst time, priority), and then the program simulates scheduling behavior and outputs start and finish times for each task.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Console-based interaction.
- Simulates 3 popular scheduling algorithms.
- Uses object-oriented principles for clean architecture.
- Includes support for Round Robin time slicing.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

This project only uses built-in Python libraries. No external packages are needed.

However, for consistency, here's a minimal `requirements.txt`:
